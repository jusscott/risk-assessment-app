# Analysis-Report Service Connectivity Fix Summary

## Issue Overview
The analysis service was experiencing connectivity issues with the report service, showing the error:
```
warn: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Report service connectivity test failed: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5005
```

## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue: Missing Environment Variable**
- The analysis service in docker-compose.yml was missing the `REPORT_SERVICE_URL` environment variable
- Without this variable, the service was falling back to `http://localhost:5005` instead of the proper Docker service name
- From within Docker containers, services need to communicate using Docker service names, not localhost

**Configuration Gap:**
- All other services had proper `REPORT_SERVICE_URL` configurations pointing to `http://report-service:5005`
- The analysis service was the only one missing this critical environment variable
- The service logs showed `Report service URL: http://localhost:5005` instead of the expected Docker service name

## Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Added Missing Environment Variable
Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include the missing environment variable for analysis-service:
```yaml
analysis-service:
  environment:
    - REPORT_SERVICE_URL=http://report-service:5005
```

### Step 2: Container Recreation
- Stopped and removed the existing analysis service container using `docker-compose down analysis-service`
- Recreated the container with `docker-compose up -d analysis-service` to ensure environment variables were properly loaded
- Service restarted successfully in 5.4 seconds

### Step 3: Connectivity Verification
- Verified environment variable was properly set: `REPORT_SERVICE_URL=http://report-service:5005`
- Confirmed successful connectivity through service logs

## Technical Details

**Before Fix:**
- Analysis service using `http://localhost:5005` (incorrect for Docker networking)
- Connection refused errors when attempting to reach report service
- Service logs showing connectivity test failures
- Missing Docker service discovery configuration

**After Fix:**
- Analysis service correctly using `http://report-service:5005` (proper Docker service name)
- Successful HTTP connectivity verification
- Service logs showing "‚úÖ Report service HTTP connectivity verified"
- Proper inter-service communication established

## Verification Results

### Environment Variable Check
```bash
docker exec analysis-service env | grep REPORT
# Output: REPORT_SERVICE_URL=http://report-service:5005
```

### Service Logs Confirmation
```
info: Report service URL: http://report-service:5005
info: ‚úÖ Report service HTTP connectivity verified  
info: ‚úÖ Report service recovered and available via HTTP
```

### Service Status
```bash
docker-compose ps
# Both analysis-service and report-service showing "healthy" status
```

## Impact Assessment

**üî¥ Before Fix:**
- Analysis service unable to communicate with report service
- Connection refused errors preventing proper service integration
- Potential analysis functionality limitations due to service communication failure

**üü¢ After Fix:**
- Complete connectivity between analysis and report services restored
- Proper Docker service discovery working as expected
- All inter-service communication fully operational
- Analysis service can now properly notify report service about completed analyses

## Resolution Time
- **Total Fix Time**: ~15 minutes from issue identification to complete resolution
- **Service Downtime**: Minimal (5.4 seconds for container recreation)
- **Issue Complexity**: Configuration oversight requiring environment variable addition

## Prevention Notes
- Ensure all services requiring inter-service communication have proper environment variables defined
- Use Docker service names (not localhost) for container-to-container communication
- Verify service environment variables after any Docker configuration changes
- Include connectivity tests in service health checks to catch similar issues early

## Key Insight
This was a **Docker networking configuration issue** where the missing environment variable caused the service to fall back to localhost instead of using proper Docker service discovery. The fix required adding the missing `REPORT_SERVICE_URL` environment variable to enable proper inter-service communication.
