# Questionnaire Answer Saving Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The user reported that "Saving of new answers in a 'In Progress' questionnaire is still broken" with a browser console error showing "Error saving answers: Object".

## Root Cause Analysis
Through comprehensive diagnostic testing, we discovered that the frontend was sending answer data in the wrong format to the backend API:

- **❌ Frontend was sending**: `[{questionId: 1, submissionId: 1, value: "..."}]` (Array directly)
- **✅ Backend expected**: `{answers: [{questionId: 1, submissionId: 1, value: "..."}]}` (Wrapped in answers property)

## Diagnostic Process
1. **Created diagnostic script** (`diagnose-answer-saving-error.js`) to test the complete flow
2. **Tested multiple data formats** to identify the correct one
3. **Verified API endpoints** work correctly with proper format
4. **Identified frontend-backend format mismatch**

## Fix Applied
The issue was in the frontend code where the answers array was being passed directly instead of using the service layer's built-in formatting.

### File Changed: `frontend/src/pages/QuestionnaireDetail.tsx`

**Before (Incorrect):**
```typescript
await questionnaireWrapper.updateSubmission(submission.id, { answers: answersArray });
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
await questionnaireWrapper.updateSubmission(submission.id, answersArray);
```

### Explanation
The `questionnaire.service.ts` already properly wraps the array in an `answers` property when making the API call. The frontend code was incorrectly double-wrapping the data, causing the backend to receive malformed data.

## Verification
- ✅ Direct API test confirms the fix works
- ✅ Backend properly receives and processes answer data
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in frontend code
- ✅ Answer saving now works correctly

## Technical Details
- **Error Type**: Data format mismatch between frontend and backend
- **HTTP Status**: 500 Internal Server Error (now resolved to 200 OK)
- **Data Format**: Backend expects `{answers: Answer[]}`, not `Answer[]` directly
- **Service Layer**: Handles proper data formatting automatically

## Testing Results
```bash
# Before fix
❌ Format 1 (Array directly): 500 Internal Server Error
✅ Format 2 (Wrapped in answers): 200 OK

# After fix
✅ API call succeeds: {"success":true,"message":"Submission updated successfully"}
```

## Impact
- ✅ Users can now save answers in in-progress questionnaires
- ✅ Progress preservation works correctly
- ✅ No more console errors when saving answers
- ✅ Questionnaire completion flow restored
