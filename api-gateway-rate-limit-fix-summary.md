# API Gateway Rate Limit Fix Summary

## Issue

After restarting the API Gateway, the following error was encountered:
```
ReferenceError: logRateLimitInfo is not defined
api-gateway  |     at Object.<anonymous> (/app/src/index.js:129:22)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error occurred because:
1. The `logRateLimitInfo` middleware function was defined in the `rate-limit.middleware.js` file
2. However, it was not properly exported in the module's exports object
3. Index.js was trying to use this middleware function without having access to it

The specific line in `index.js` causing the error was:
```javascript
app.use('/api/auth', logRateLimitInfo, authLimiter, authRoutes);
```

## Solution

Added the `logRateLimitInfo` function to the module exports in `rate-limit.middleware.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apiLimiter,
  authLimiter,
  reportLimiter,
  analysisLimiter,
  healthLimiter,
  createRateLimiter,
  logRateLimitInfo  // Added this export
};
```

This makes the function available for use in `index.js`.

## Implementation Steps

1. Identified the error location in `index.js` (line 129)
2. Found the `logRateLimitInfo` function definition in `rate-limit.middleware.js`
3. Added the missing export to the module.exports object
4. Created a restart script for the API Gateway to apply the changes

## Testing

After implementing the fix, the API Gateway can be restarted using the `restart-api-gateway.sh` script.

## Related Components

- **api-gateway/src/index.js**: Main application entry point that uses the middleware
- **api-gateway/src/middlewares/rate-limit.middleware.js**: Middleware that contains rate limiting logic
- **rate limit diagnostics**: The `logRateLimitInfo` function provides debugging information for rate limiting issues

## Future Recommendations

1. When adding utility functions to middleware modules, always ensure they're properly exported if they need to be used outside the module
2. Consider improving the API Gateway's error handling to provide more context when middleware-related errors occur
3. Consider implementing integration tests that verify all middleware dependencies are properly resolved
