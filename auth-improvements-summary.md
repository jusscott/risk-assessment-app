# Authentication Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to address authentication issues in the Risk Assessment App.

## 1. Optimized Authentication Middleware

We've created a new optimized authentication middleware for the questionnaire service that addresses concurrent JWT validation issues:

```
risk-assessment-app/backend/questionnaire-service/src/middlewares/optimized-auth.middleware.js
```

Key features:
- **Token validation caching**: Reduces repeated validation calls for the same token
- **Mutex protection**: Prevents race conditions during concurrent validation requests
- **Fallback validation**: Performs local validation when auth service is unavailable
- **Request tracking**: Uses unique request IDs for better tracing and debugging
- **Improved error handling**: More detailed error responses and logging

## 2. Extended Token Refresh Pattern

We've extended the token refresh pattern to additional frontend services:

1. Fixed `profile-wrapper.ts` to correctly match the actual profile service interface
2. Created `reports-wrapper.ts` to implement token refresh for the report service

This ensures all API calls are made with fresh tokens, preventing authentication errors from expired tokens.

## 3. Monitoring for Authentication Issues

Created a comprehensive monitoring tool for detecting authentication issues:

```
risk-assessment-app/backend/questionnaire-service/scripts/monitor-auth-issues.js
```

Features:
- Real-time monitoring of authentication logs
- Detection of concurrent validation spikes
- Alerting on high error rates
- Statistics collection and reporting
- Endpoint-specific error tracking

## 4. Applied Optimized Authentication to Routes

Updated routes to use the new optimized authentication middleware:
- Submission routes
- Template routes

## Running the Monitor

To monitor for authentication issues:

```bash
cd risk-assessment-app/backend/questionnaire-service
LOG_PATH=./logs LOG_FILE=questionnaire-service.log ./scripts/monitor-auth-issues.js
```

Environment variables:
- `LOG_PATH`: Directory for logs (default: ./logs)
- `LOG_FILE`: Name of the log file (default: questionnaire-service.log)
- `WATCH_INTERVAL_MS`: Interval for checking log changes (default: 1000)
- `ALERT_THRESHOLD`: Number of errors within time window to trigger alert (default: 3)
- `TIME_WINDOW_MS`: Time window for error counting (default: 60000)

## Required Packages

Added dependency:
- node-cache: For efficient token validation caching

## Next Steps

1. Apply similar optimization patterns to other services that experience high concurrent requests
2. Consider implementing a distributed cache for token validation when scaling across multiple instances
3. Add monitoring dashboards for authentication metrics
