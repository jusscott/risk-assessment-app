# Authentication System Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address login/logout issues in the risk assessment application.

## Issues Addressed

1. **ResizeObserver Error**: After logging out and attempting to log back in, the following error appeared:
   ```
   Uncaught runtime errors:
   ERROR
   ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications.
   at handleError (http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:156043:58)
   at http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:156062:7
   ```

2. **API Gateway Restart Issue**: The API gateway service would occasionally get stuck during restart, particularly after authentication operations.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. ResizeObserver Error Fix

The ResizeObserver error occurs during the logout/login transition when components using the ResizeObserver are unmounted and remounted quickly. We implemented a utility in `frontend/src/utils/resize-observer-fix.ts` that intercepts and handles these errors gracefully.

This fix prevents the error from appearing in the console and allows the login process to continue smoothly.

### 2. API Gateway Restart Script

We created a robust script to fix issues with stuck API Gateway processes:
- Forcefully terminates any hanging API Gateway processes
- Attempts multiple restart methods (npm, direct Node.js, Docker)
- Clears cache and temporary files that might be causing issues
- Verifies the health of the restarted service
- Provides detailed logging and status information

## Usage Instructions

### To Fix ResizeObserver Login Issues

If you encounter the ResizeObserver error when logging out and back in:

1. Restart just the frontend server:
   ```bash
   ./restart-frontend.sh
   ```

2. If the issue persists, try the full application restart:
   ```bash
   ./restart-all-services.sh
   ```

### To Fix Stuck API Gateway

If the API Gateway becomes stuck or unresponsive:

1. Run the API Gateway fix script:
   ```bash
   ./fix-api-gateway.sh
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Terminate any hanging API Gateway processes
   - Restart the service using the best available method
   - Verify the service is running correctly
   - Provide detailed output about what it's doing

3. After the script completes, try accessing the application again.

## Preventative Measures

To minimize these issues in the future:

1. **For Developers**:
   - Use the ResizeObserver utility in any component that employs ResizeObserver functionality
   - Implement proper component cleanup on unmount in React components
   - Add timeout and retry logic for API calls during authentication flows

2. **For System Administrators**:
   - Regularly monitor the API Gateway service health
   - Consider implementing the provided scripts in system monitoring tools
   - Schedule periodic service restarts during low-usage periods

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after using these scripts:

1. Check the log files:
   - Frontend logs: Usually in the browser console
   - API Gateway logs: Check `api-gateway.log` and `api-gateway-direct.log` in the API Gateway directory

2. Verify network connectivity between services:
   - Use the health endpoints at `/api/health` to check service status
   - Verify database connectivity if authentication relies on database access

3. Check system resources:
   - Memory utilization
   - Disk space
   - Network port availability

4. For persistent issues, try a complete system restart:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
