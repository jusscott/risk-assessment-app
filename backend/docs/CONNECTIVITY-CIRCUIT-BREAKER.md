## Circuit Breaker Pattern

### Concept and Purpose

The circuit breaker pattern is a design pattern used to detect failures and prevent them from constantly recurring. It's implemented as a proxy that monitors the number of recent failures. Once the failures reach a certain threshold, the circuit "trips" and prevents further attempts to the failing service for a specified period, after which the circuit allows a limited number of test requests to determine if the service has recovered.

### Key Advantages

- Prevents system overload when a service is failing
- Provides fast failure responses instead of waiting for timeouts
- Enables self-healing through automatic recovery testing
- Protects against cascading failures across the microservice architecture

### Circuit States

The circuit breaker operates in three states:

1. **Closed**: Normal operation, requests pass through to the service
2. **Open**: Circuit is tripped, requests fail fast without attempting to call the service
3. **Half-Open**: Recovery testing, limited requests allowed to test if service has recovered

### State Transitions

```
[Closed] → (Error threshold exceeded) → [Open] →
(Reset timeout expires) → [Half-Open] →
(Test requests succeed) → [Closed]
OR
(Test requests fail) → [Open]
```

## Enhanced Client Implementation

We've implemented a shared enhanced HTTP client (`enhanced-client.js`) that incorporates the circuit breaker pattern and provides consistent behavior across all services.

### Core Features

1. **Circuit Breaker Logic**:
   - Tracks failures and success rates
   - Implements state transition logic
   - Provides detailed status information

2. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - Configurable retry counts and delays
   - Exponential backoff strategy
   - Intelligent retry decisions based on error types

3. **Timeout Handling**:
   - Configurable connection timeouts
   - Keep-alive timeout management
   - Proper resource cleanup on timeout

4. **Monitoring Capabilities**:
   - Detailed metrics collection
   - Status reporting endpoints
   - Logging of circuit state changes

### Example Implementation

```javascript
// Example usage of the enhanced client
const enhancedClient = require('./enhanced-client');

const serviceClient = enhancedClient.createClient({
  baseUrl: 'http://service-name:3000',
  serviceName: 'service-name',
  maxRetries: 3,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  circuitBreakerThreshold: 5,
  resetTimeout: 30000
});

// Making a request with circuit breaker protection
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await serviceClient.request({
      method: 'get',
      url: '/api/data'
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.isCircuitOpen) {
      // Handle circuit open case
      return fallbackData();
    }
    // Handle other errors
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Health Monitoring System

We've implemented a comprehensive health monitoring system that integrates with the circuit breaker pattern to provide detailed insights into service health and circuit status.

### Multi-Level Health Checks

The implementation provides multiple levels of health monitoring:

- **Basic**: Simple health checks to verify service availability
- **Detailed**: Comprehensive health information including metrics
- **Component-Level**: Specific metrics for databases, caches, etc.
- **System-Wide**: Aggregated health information across all services

### Circuit Breaker Integration

The health monitoring system integrates with the circuit breaker implementation:

- Shows current circuit status for each service
- Includes circuit breaker metrics
- Helps identify services with reliability issues

### Performance Optimization

To ensure the health monitoring system itself doesn't impact application performance:

- Implemented an intelligent caching system with configurable TTL
- Made cache bypass available when needed
- Added admin controls for cache management

### API Structure

The health monitoring system provides the following API endpoints:

1. **Public Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/health/system` - Overall system health
   - `GET /api/health/services/:service` - Service-specific health
   - `GET /api/health/metrics/:service/:component` - Component metrics

2. **Admin Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/security/health-dashboard` - Admin health dashboard
   - `GET /api/security/circuit-status` - Circuit breaker status
   - `POST /api/health/reset-cache` - Reset health monitoring caches

## Circuit Breaker Monitoring

We've implemented an automated circuit breaker monitoring system that provides proactive monitoring, alerting, and optional automatic recovery for circuit breakers across the application.

### Key Features

1. **Status Monitoring**
   - Polls circuit status at configurable intervals
   - Tracks state changes across all services
   - Maintains detailed status history

2. **Alerting System**
   - Generates alerts for prolonged circuit open states
   - Supports email and Slack notifications
   - Configurable alert thresholds and cooldown periods

3. **Historical Data**
   - Stores circuit state history for analysis
   - Helps identify recurring issues
   - Supports trend analysis and reporting

4. **Automatic Recovery**
   - Optional feature to reset stuck circuits
   - Configurable thresholds and attempt limits
   - Respects circuit breaker principles

### Architecture

The circuit breaker monitoring system runs as a containerized service that:

1. Periodically polls the API Gateway's `/circuit-status` endpoint
2. Tracks circuit states and detects changes
3. Generates alerts when circuits remain open for too long
4. Optionally attempts recovery for stuck circuits
5. Stores historical data for analysis

## Configuration Options

The circuit breaker implementation provides extensive configuration options to customize behavior for different services and requirements.

### Core Circuit Breaker Configuration

```javascript
const defaultConfig = {
  maxRetries: 3,                  // Maximum retry attempts
  retryDelay: 1000,               // Delay between retries (ms)
  connectionTimeout: 5000,        // Request timeout (ms)
  keepAliveTimeout: 60000,        // Keep-alive timeout (ms)
  circuitBreakerThreshold: 3,     // Failures before opening circuit
  resetTimeout: 30000,            // Time before testing recovery (ms)
  errorThresholdPercentage: 50    // Error rate to open circuit (%)
};
```

### Monitoring Configuration

```javascript
const monitoringConfig = {
  pollingInterval: 60000,         // Status polling interval (ms)
  alertThreshold: 2,              // Consecutive checks before alerting
  recoveryAttempts: 3,            // Maximum recovery attempts
  recoveryInterval: 300000,       // Interval between recovery attempts (ms)
  historyRetentionDays: 30,       // Days to keep historical data
  enableEmailAlerts: false,       // Enable email notifications
  enableSlackAlerts: false,       // Enable Slack notifications
  enableAutoRecovery: true        // Enable automatic circuit recovery
};
```

### Health Check Configuration

```javascript
const healthCheckConfig = {
  cacheTTL: 60000,                // Cache time-to-live (ms)
  timeout: 2000,                  // Health check timeout (ms)
  concurrentChecks: 5,            // Maximum concurrent health checks
  detailedChecksRequireAuth: true // Require auth for detailed checks
};
```

## Monitoring Dashboard

The circuit breaker implementation includes monitoring capabilities through:

1. **API Gateway Health Dashboard**:
   - Centralized view of all service health statuses
   - Circuit breaker state visualization
   - Request success/failure metrics
   - Historical state transitions

2. **Circuit Breaker Monitor**:
   - Historical circuit state tracking
   - Alert history and resolution status
   - Recovery attempt logging
   - Trend analysis and patterns

## Testing and Verification

After implementation, you can verify the circuit breaker functionality with these steps:

1. Start all services normally
2. Check `/health` and `/circuit-status` endpoints to confirm normal operation
3. Shut down one service (e.g., Questionnaire Service)
4. Make requests to the stopped service through API Gateway
5. Verify the circuit transitions from "closed" to "open"
6. Restart the service
7. Verify the circuit automatically transitions to "half-open" and then "closed"
