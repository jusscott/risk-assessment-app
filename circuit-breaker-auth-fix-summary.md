# Auth Service Circuit Breaker Fix

## Problem Summary
The Risk Assessment app questionnaire service was failing when the auth service became unavailable. From log analysis:

1. `Circuit breaker for [object Object] opened` - Improper circuit breaker triggering without proper event handling
2. `Network error connecting to auth service: ETIMEDOUT` - Auth service timeouts not handled gracefully
3. `Error during token validation: Breaker is open` - No proper fallback mechanism when circuit is open
4. `USING FALLBACK LOCAL TOKEN VALIDATION - AUTH SERVICE UNAVAILABLE` - Fallback attempted but failed
5. `Token verification failed: invalid signature` - JWT signature validation failed in fallback mode due to key mismatch

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Client Wrapper
- Created a robust circuit breaker implementation with proper event emission
- Handles service unavailability gracefully with configurable timeouts
- Standardized error handling across service calls

### 2. Token Utility Improvements
- Implemented consistent JWT secret across services for proper fallback validation
- Enhanced token validation logic with fallback modes
- Added better error handling and logging
- Maintained security while providing resilience

### 3. Authentication Middleware Resilience
- Added circuit breaker awareness to the auth middleware
- Implemented different validation strategies based on circuit state
- Optimized performance during auth service unavailability

### 4. System-Wide Event Handling
- Added global event emitter for cross-component communication
- Implemented proper circuit breaker state change events
- Added health endpoint reporting for monitoring

### 5. Execution Scripts
- **apply-auth-circuit-breaker-fix.sh**: Applies all fixes and configurations
- **restart-for-circuit-breaker-fix.sh**: Restarts services to apply changes
- **fix-and-restart-questionnaire-auth.sh**: One-command fix application

## Testing the Fix

To test the circuit breaker functionality:

1. Apply the fix: 
   ```
   ./apply-auth-circuit-breaker-fix.sh
   ./restart-for-circuit-breaker-fix.sh
   ```

2. Test auth service failure scenario:
   ```
   # Stop auth service
   docker-compose stop auth-service
   
   # Make requests to questionnaire service (should continue working)
   curl http://localhost:4002/api/questionnaires
   
   # Restart auth service
   docker-compose start auth-service
   
   # System should auto-recover
   ```

## Technical Implementation

1. **Enhanced Client Wrapper**:
   - Utilizes EventEmitter for state management
   - Implements circuit breaker pattern with configurable thresholds
   - Provides singleton for consistent circuit state tracking

2. **Token Validation Fallback**:
   - Uses process.env.CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FALLBACK_ENABLED flag to toggle modes
   - Implements local JWT verification when auth service is down
   - Shares JWT secret across services for consistency

3. **Global Event Handling**:
   - Registers event listeners for circuit state changes
   - Updates environment configuration based on circuit state
   - Provides consistent logging across components

This fix ensures the questionnaire service can continue to function during auth service outages while maintaining security and minimizing user impact.
