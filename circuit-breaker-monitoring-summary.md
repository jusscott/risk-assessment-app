# Circuit Breaker Monitoring System Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented an automated monitoring system for the circuit breaker pattern used across all microservices in the Risk Assessment Application. This monitoring system will track the status of all circuit breakers, provide alerts when circuits are open, maintain historical data, and optionally attempt automatic recovery.

## Components Implemented

1. **Core Monitoring Service**:
   - Created `circuit-breaker-monitor.js` - A Node.js service that periodically checks circuit status and performs various monitoring functions.
   - Includes comprehensive logging, alerting, and recovery mechanisms.
   - Configurable through environment variables for flexibility in different environments.

2. **Supporting Files**:
   - Added `package.json` with all required dependencies (axios, winston, node-schedule).
   - Created `Dockerfile` for containerization of the monitoring service.
   - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include the monitoring service alongside other microservices.
   - Added detailed documentation in `README.md`.

3. **Integration with Existing Components**:
   - Leverages the existing `/circuit-status` endpoint in the API Gateway to check circuit status.
   - Uses the existing `/circuit-reset` endpoint for recovery operations when circuits are stuck open.

## Features

### 1. Status Monitoring
- Polls the API Gateway's `/circuit-status` endpoint at configurable intervals (default: 1 minute)
- Tracks the state of all circuit breakers across all services
- Logs state changes (when circuits open or close)

### 2. Alerting System
- Generates alerts when circuits remain open for a configurable number of checks (default: 2)
- Supports email notifications (disabled by default, can be enabled via environment variables)
- Supports Slack notifications (disabled by default, can be enabled via environment variables)
- Sends resolution notifications when circuits close after being open

### 3. Historical Data
- Stores circuit breaker status history in JSON files organized by date
- Configurable retention period (default: 30 days)
- Includes timestamps, service names, and detailed state information
- Enables analysis of failure patterns and service reliability

### 4. Automatic Recovery
- Optional feature (enabled by default in Docker setup)
- Attempts to reset circuits that have been open for too long
- Configurable thresholds, attempt limits, and cooldown periods
- Respects circuit breaker principles while providing additional resilience

### 5. Observability
- Comprehensive logging to both console and files
- Detailed state tracking for debugging and analysis
- Historical data for trend analysis and system improvement

## Configuration Options

The monitoring system is highly configurable through environment variables, including:
- Polling interval
- Alert thresholds
- Recovery settings
- Notification channels
- Data retention periods

## Deployment

The monitoring service is configured to run as a Docker container alongside other services in the application. It's set up to:
- Start automatically when the system starts
- Depend on the API Gateway service
- Restart automatically if it crashes
- Mount appropriate volumes for data and log storage

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:
1. A web UI for visualizing circuit breaker status
2. More sophisticated recovery strategies
3. Machine learning for predictive failure detection
4. Integration with external monitoring tools

## Conclusion

This automated monitoring system completes the circuit breaker implementation by providing essential monitoring, alerting, and recovery capabilities. It increases the system's resilience by enabling quick detection and response to service failures, while maintaining historical data for ongoing improvement of the system's reliability.
