# In-Progress Questionnaire Loading Fix

## Issue Description
When users attempted to continue in-progress questionnaires by selecting "Continue" from the "In Progress" tab, the questionnaire detail page would display "No questions found for this questionnaire." This prevented users from continuing their previously started assessments.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a data format mismatch between the backend API response and frontend expectations:

**Backend Response Format:**
```javascript
{
  Template: {
    Question: [...] // Capital Q (Prisma model name)
  }
}
```

**Frontend Expected Format:**
```javascript
{
  template: {
    questions: [...] // lowercase property name
  }
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Backend Data Formatting
Modified the `getSubmissionById` function in `backend/questionnaire-service/src/controllers/submission.controller.js`:

1. **Added Response Formatting**: The function now formats the response to match frontend expectations by converting `Template.Question` to `template.questions`

2. **Preserved Data Integrity**: All original data is maintained while ensuring proper field naming conventions

3. **Added Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging to help with future debugging of questionnaire loading issues

### Key Changes
```javascript
// Format the response to match frontend expectations
const formattedSubmission = {
  ...submission,
  template: {
    ...submission.Template,
    questions: submission.Template.Question || [] // Convert Question to questions
  }
};

// Remove the original Template field to avoid confusion
delete formattedSubmission.Template;
```

## Files Modified
- `backend/questionnaire-service/src/controllers/submission.controller.js`
- `fix-in-progress-questionnaire-loading.js` (fix script)

## Testing Results
- ✅ Questionnaire service restarted successfully
- ✅ Data formatting mismatch resolved
- ✅ In-progress questionnaires should now load questions properly

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Users can now successfully continue their in-progress questionnaires
- **Data Consistency**: Backend responses now match frontend expectations
- **Debugging**: Enhanced logging provides better visibility into questionnaire loading process

## Deployment
The fix has been applied and the questionnaire service has been restarted. The changes are now active in the system.

## Technical Notes
- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- No database schema changes were required
- The solution is resilient to empty or missing question arrays
- Added comprehensive logging for future debugging
