# Logout Navigation Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The application had an issue with the logout functionality where clicking the logout button from any page would unexpectedly redirect the user to the dashboard instead of properly logging them out and redirecting to the login page. Additionally, if the user manually removed any page name from the URL, they would be taken to the home page (non-authenticated state) and would need to log in again.

## Technical Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, the issue was identified as a race condition in the logout workflow:

1. When a user clicked the logout button, the `handleLogout` function in `MainLayout.tsx` was triggered
2. This function executed two actions in sequence:
   - `await dispatch(logout())` - Dispatched the logout action to clear auth state and tokens
   - `navigate('/login')` - Immediately navigated to the login page

3. The race condition occurred because:
   - The manual navigation to '/login' happened immediately after dispatching logout
   - However, the Redux state update (setting `isAuthenticated` to false) hadn't completed yet
   - The `useAuthNavigation` hook detected the user was still authenticated (stale state)
   - This hook then redirected authenticated users away from the login page to the dashboard
   - This redirection happened AFTER the intended navigation to login, causing the unexpected behavior

4. The persistence issue occurred because:
   - Token management was functioning correctly (tokens were cleared)
   - But the manual navigation interfered with the proper authentication flow

## Solution Implemented

The solution was to remove the manual navigation command from the logout handler and rely entirely on the `useAuthNavigation` hook to handle the redirection once the Redux state was properly updated:

```javascript
// BEFORE: Manual navigation that caused race condition
const handleLogout = async () => {
  await dispatch(logout());
  navigate('/login'); // This line caused the problem
};

// AFTER: Let authentication state drive navigation
const handleLogout = async () => {
  await dispatch(logout());
  // Navigation will be handled by useAuthNavigation hook once state is updated
};
```

This change ensures that:
1. The logout action is dispatched and fully processed
2. The Redux state is updated to reflect the user is no longer authenticated
3. The `useAuthNavigation` hook detects this state change and redirects to the login page accordingly
4. No race conditions occur since we're allowing the authentication flow to complete naturally

## Implementation Details

1. Modified `risk-assessment-app/frontend/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx`
   - Removed manual navigation after logout dispatch
   - Added comment explaining the authentication flow

2. Created restart script `restart-frontend-for-logout-fix.sh` to easily apply changes

## Testing Instructions

To test the fix:

1. Apply the changes by running the restart script:
   ```bash
   ./risk-assessment-app/restart-frontend-for-logout-fix.sh
   ```

2. Navigate to any authenticated page in the application (dashboard, reports, etc.)

3. Click the logout button:
   - You should be properly logged out (auth tokens cleared)
   - You should be redirected to the login page
   - The URL should change to '/login'

4. Try to navigate back to an authenticated page:
   - You should remain on the login page as you're no longer authenticated
   - No unexpected redirection to the dashboard should occur

5. Log back in:
   - You should be able to successfully log in again
   - You should be redirected to the dashboard
