# P3005 Migration Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The questionnaire service was experiencing a P3005 migration error during Step 3 of the database migrations. 

Error P3005 in Prisma typically occurs when a migration attempts to create tables that already exist in the database but aren't tracked in the _prisma_migrations table. This is a common issue when:

1. The database schema was created manually or through another tool
2. A previous migration was applied but not recorded properly in the _prisma_migrations table
3. The database was restored from a backup without its migration history

## Diagnosis

After analysis, we determined that:
- The database schema was present (with tables for Template, Question, Submission, Answer)
- However, the _prisma_migrations table was either missing or didn't contain records for these migrations
- This caused Prisma to attempt to recreate tables during migration, resulting in the P3005 error

## Solution

### 1. Fix Migration Tracking
We created a script that:
- Checks if the _prisma_migrations table exists, creating it if necessary
- Inspects the existing database schema to confirm tables already exist
- Adds a migration record for the initial migration to prevent Prisma from attempting to recreate tables
- The record (with ID '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001') marks the migration as applied

### 2. Create Test Data
After fixing the migration issue, we created test questionnaire data:
- One draft questionnaire (partially completed with 5 answers)
- One completed questionnaire (fully completed with 10 answers)
- One additional completed questionnaire with a different template

### 3. Verification
- We verified the API connectivity is working (200 response from health endpoint)
- Confirmed test submissions were created successfully (IDs 9, 10, and 11)

## Technical Details

The fix was implemented using two scripts:

1. **fix-p3005-docker-exec.js**
   - Creates scripts to run inside the Docker container
   - Adds the missing migration record
   - Confirms database schema is intact

2. **create-fixed-test-data.js**
   - Creates test submissions in the database
   - Sets up one draft and two completed submissions
   - Assigns different templates and answers

## Avoiding Future Issues

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always use Prisma migrations for schema changes rather than direct SQL
2. When restoring databases from backups, ensure migration history is included
3. If you need to make manual schema changes, record them properly in the _prisma_migrations table
4. Use `prisma migrate resolve` command to manually mark migrations as applied when necessary

## Next Steps

The questionnaire service should now be functioning correctly, with sample data ready for testing. You can:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/questionnaires to view the test submissions
2. Verify that both draft and submitted questionnaires appear correctly
3. Run any integration tests that depend on questionnaire data
