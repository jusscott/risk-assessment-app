# Profile Update Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When a user made changes to their profile (specifically the company field) and hit the "Update Profile" button, the UI showed a success message but the changes were not actually persisted. Even after logging out and logging back in, the changes were not visible.

## Root Cause Analysis
The root cause was identified in the Redux implementation. When examining the codebase:

1. The `Profile.tsx` component correctly calls the `getCurrentUser` Redux action after successful profile update:
   ```typescript
   // In Profile.tsx
   await profileWrapper.updateProfile(profileData);
   setSuccess(true);
   dispatch(getCurrentUser());
   ```

2. However, in `authSlice.ts`, while the `getCurrentUser` action was defined, there were no corresponding reducer cases to handle the response from this action. 

3. The Redux store was not being updated with the new user information when the API call to get the current user succeeded.

## Solution
Added the missing reducer cases in `authSlice.ts` to handle all states of the `getCurrentUser` action:

```typescript
// Added these reducer cases in authSlice.ts
.addCase(getCurrentUser.pending, (state) => {
  state.isLoading = true;
  state.error = null;
})
.addCase(getCurrentUser.fulfilled, (state, action: PayloadAction<User>) => {
  state.isLoading = false;
  state.user = action.payload;
  state.error = null;
})
.addCase(getCurrentUser.rejected, (state, action) => {
  state.isLoading = false;
  state.isAuthenticated = false;
  state.user = null;
  state.token = null;
  state.error = action.payload as string || 'Failed to get current user';
});
```

## Testing
The fix was verified by:
1. Updating the Redux slice to include the missing reducer cases
2. Testing the profile update functionality
3. Confirming that the user's profile information is correctly updated and persisted

## Lessons Learned
1. When implementing Redux async thunks, ensure that all three states (pending, fulfilled, rejected) have corresponding reducer cases in the slice.
2. Even if an action is dispatched correctly, without the proper reducer cases, the state won't be updated.
3. For profile updates or any data refresh operations, it's important to have a complete data flow from API to state management to UI rendering.
