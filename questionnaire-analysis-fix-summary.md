# Questionnaire Analysis Connectivity Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Case Sensitivity in Prisma Relations**: Fixed incorrect lowercase "questions" reference in the `submitQuestionnaire` method of the submission controller, which didn't match the capitalized "Question" model name defined in the Prisma schema.

2. **Analysis Service Connection Refusal**: Implemented enhanced client pattern for resilient connections to the analysis service, resolving ECONNREFUSED errors (127.0.0.1:5004) by properly using Docker service names.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed Case Sensitivity Issue

The Prisma schema defined models with capital letters (`Question`, `Template`), but the controller code was using lowercase `questions` in the query include pattern. This mismatch caused Prisma to return empty results when loading questions.

```javascript
// Before
Template: {
  include: {
    questions: {
      where: { ... }
    }
  }
}

// After
Template: {
  include: {
    Question: {
      where: { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Client Implementation

Created an enhanced HTTP client with circuit breaker pattern for resilient communication with the analysis service:

- Properly uses Docker service names instead of localhost
- Built-in circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures
- Automatic retries and failure counting
- Timeout handling and connection resilience

```javascript
// Before
const analysisResponse = await axios.get(
  `${config.analysisService.url}/results/${submission.id}`,
  { timeout: 3000 }
);

// After
const analysisResponse = await analysisClient.get(`/results/${submission.id}`);
```

## Benefits

1. **Proper Question Loading**: Questions now load correctly for questionnaires by using the proper model name capitalization.

2. **Service Resilience**: The enhanced client provides better handling of network issues between services:
   - Circuit breaker prevents overwhelming a failing service
   - Proper Docker networking resolution using service names
   - More detailed error logging and failure tracking
   - Automatic recovery attempts after failures

3. **Error Prevention**: The error "Could not fetch analysis for submission: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5004" is now prevented through proper service discovery and resilient connections.

## Files Modified

- `backend/questionnaire-service/src/controllers/submission.controller.js`
- Created `backend/questionnaire-service/src/utils/enhanced-client.js`

## Testing

- Verified questionnaire questions now load correctly
- Confirmed analysis service connections are successful
- Tested both new and in-progress questionnaires
