# Questionnaire Authentication Fixes

## Issues Fixed

This update addresses two critical problems with questionnaire functionality:

1. **Logout Issue**: Users were being logged out immediately when clicking "Start a new questionnaire assessment" on any available questionnaire.
2. **Loading Failure**: Error message "Failed to load questionnaires" appeared on the questionnaire page after authentication.

## Root Causes

After thorough analysis, the following root causes were identified:

### Logout Issue (when starting questionnaires)

1. **Token Handling Issues**:
   - The authentication token wasn't being properly validated during the questionnaire start process
   - The frontend was not proactively refreshing tokens before making API calls
   - When starting a questionnaire, token validation was failing during navigation

2. **Navigation Issues**:
   - React Router navigation was causing authentication state to be lost during page transitions
   - The session was being invalidated during redirection to the questionnaire detail page

### Failed to Load Questionnaires Error

1. **Error Handling Deficiencies**:
   - The frontend wasn't gracefully handling API failures
   - Token validation failures weren't being properly handled in the API calls
   - Error states weren't being properly captured and displayed

2. **Authentication Flow Issues**:
   - The questionnaire service was rejecting valid tokens with minor formatting issues
   - The token caching mechanism in the backend was not functioning correctly
   - Error responses weren't providing enough context for proper frontend handling

## Solutions Implemented

### Backend (Questionnaire Service) Fixes

1. **Improved Token Validation**:
   - Enhanced token validation with better error handling
   - Added more robust token caching to reduce validation overhead 
   - Improved error reporting for token validation failures

2. **More Resilient Authentication Middleware**:
   - Added fallback mechanisms for token validation failures
   - Improved logging for authentication issues
   - Added better bypass handling for development/test environments
   - Enhanced special handling for questionnaire endpoints

### Frontend Fixes

1. **Enhanced Questionnaire Component**:
   - Added robust token refresh before API calls
   - Improved session state management during navigation
   - Added multiple cleanup mechanisms for session flags
   - Implemented better error handling for specific 401 errors

2. **Improved Service Layer**:
   - Enhanced questionnaire wrapper with better error handling
   - Added thorough token refresh logic
   - Improved resilience in API calls
   - Added clear error states for better user feedback

3. **Token Utility Improvements**:
   - Added more robust token validation
   - Enhanced error handling for token extraction
   - Improved user object consistency

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the fix script to apply all changes:

```bash
node fix-questionnaire-auth-issues.js
```

2. Restart the necessary services:

```bash
bash restart-for-auth-fix.sh
```

3. Clear browser cache and cookies to ensure a clean state for testing.

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing authentication flows
- Development/test environment bypasses are preserved for local development
- Error logging has been enhanced to help troubleshoot any future issues
- Token caching and validation have been improved for better performance
