# Questionnaire Service Circuit Breaker Fix Summary

## Issue

The Questionnaire service was failing to start with the following error:

```
SyntaxError: Identifier 'authCircuitOpen' has already been declared
    at Object.compileFunction (node:vm:360:18)
    at wrapSafe (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1126:15)
    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1162:27)
```

This error occurred because the `authCircuitOpen` variable was being declared multiple times in different modules that were being imported together. The issue was specifically in the circuit breaker implementation for handling authentication service failures.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The `enhanced-client-wrapper.js` file was declaring a variable `authCircuitOpen` that tracked the state of the auth service circuit breaker.
2. This variable was also being imported or declared elsewhere in the application, causing a naming conflict.
3. When Node.js tried to compile the module, it detected the duplicate variable declaration, resulting in the SyntaxError.

## Solution

### 1. Modified the Circuit Breaker State Management

Instead of using standalone variables, we implemented a global state object approach for tracking circuit breaker status:

```javascript
// Create global state object if it doesn't exist
if (!global.circuitBreakerState) {
  global.circuitBreakerState = {
    authCircuitOpen: false
  };
}
```

This approach ensures that regardless of import order or multiple imports, the state is shared consistently across the application.

### 2. Updated Event Handlers

Updated the circuit breaker event handlers to use the global state object:

```javascript
breaker.on('open', () => {
  // Update global circuit state
  global.circuitBreakerState.authCircuitOpen = true;
  this.eventEmitter.emit('circuit-open', { service: 'auth-service' });
});

breaker.on('close', () => {
  // Update global circuit state
  global.circuitBreakerState.authCircuitOpen = false;
  this.eventEmitter.emit('circuit-close', { service: 'auth-service' });
});
```

### 3. Updated Health Check Endpoint

Modified the health check endpoint in `index.js` to use the safer type-checking approach when accessing the circuit breaker status:

```javascript
const authCircuitStatus = typeof authServiceClient.isAuthCircuitOpen === 'function' ?
  authServiceClient.isAuthCircuitOpen() :
  process.env.CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FALLBACK_ENABLED === 'true';
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Eliminates Duplicate Declarations**: Removes the variable naming conflict by using a global state object.
2. **Improves Maintainability**: Makes the circuit breaker state management more centralized and easier to track.
3. **Enhances Robustness**: Adds type checking to handle edge cases where the function might not be available.
4. **Preserves Functionality**: Maintains all existing circuit breaker functionality while fixing the error.

## Testing

The fix was tested by:
1. Restarting the questionnaire service using the provided restart script
2. Verifying the service starts without any errors
3. Testing the health endpoint to confirm circuit breaker status reporting works correctly

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a more robust state management system for circuit breakers across services
2. Add additional logging for circuit breaker state changes to improve debugging
3. Implement automated tests specifically for circuit breaker failover scenarios
