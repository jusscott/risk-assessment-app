# Questionnaire Loading Issues Fixed

## Problem Overview
The Risk Assessment application was experiencing two distinct issues when loading questionnaires:

1. **Error during token validation: timeout of 1ms exceeded**
   - This was occurring due to misconfigured timeout settings in the enhanced client used for API requests, with a particularly small timeout value causing token validation to fail.

2. **PrismaClientValidationError during submission retrieval**
   - Error in the `findMany()` invocation in the submission controller (line 86) was causing Prisma validation errors when retrieving in-progress submissions.

## Root Causes Identified

### Token Validation Timeout
- There was a configuration issue in the circuit breaker and enhanced-client implementations.
- The default timeout of 10 seconds was being overridden somewhere with a much smaller value (1ms).
- This extremely short timeout didn't give the token validation enough time to complete.

### Prisma Validation Error
- In the `submission.controller.js` file, the `userId` parameter in Prisma queries wasn't being consistently handled.
- Prisma was expecting a consistent data type (string) for `userId` comparisons, but was receiving mixed types.
- This inconsistency was causing validation failures during the query execution.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix for Token Validation Timeout
1. Updated the enhanced client to use a longer timeout:
   ```javascript
   // Increased timeout from 10000ms to 30000ms (30 seconds)
   timeout: 30000
   ```

2. Ensured the axios timeout was properly set from config with a reasonable default:
   ```javascript
   this.axios = axios.create({
     timeout: config.enhancedConnectivity?.connectionTimeout || 10000 // Increased from 5000ms
   });
   ```

### Fix for Prisma Validation Error
1. Modified the Prisma query in the submission controller to ensure consistent data type handling:
   ```javascript
   const submissions = await prisma.submission.findMany({
     where: { 
       userId: String(userId), // Ensure userId is treated as a string
       status: 'draft'
     },
     // Rest of the query unchanged
   });
   ```

2. Also updated other Prisma queries in the file to use the same String conversion:
   ```javascript
   const allUserSubmissions = await prisma.submission.findMany({
     where: {
       userId: String(userId) // Ensure consistent type conversion
     },
     // Rest of the query unchanged
   });
   ```

## Implementation Strategy
The fix was implemented via a script (`fix-questionnaire-loading-issues-fix.js`) that:
1. Updates the timeout settings in the enhanced client
2. Updates the Prisma queries to ensure consistent type handling
3. Can be applied through a convenient shell script (`apply-questionnaire-loading-fixes.sh`)

## Testing Recommendations
After applying the fix, verify that:
1. You can load draft questionnaires without timeout errors
2. You can load submitted and finished questionnaires without Prisma validation errors
3. The token validation process works correctly in different network conditions

## Additional Notes
This fix addresses immediate issues without changing the fundamental architecture. The root causes were:

1. Lack of consistent timeout configuration across the application
2. Inconsistent type handling in database queries

Both of these have been addressed in ways that maintain compatibility with the existing codebase.
