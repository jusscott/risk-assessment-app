# Questionnaire Service Restart Fix

## Issue
The questionnaire service was failing to start due to a SyntaxError: `Identifier 'authServiceClient' has already been declared`. This indicates a duplicate variable declaration in the codebase.

## Root Cause
After investigating, we found the duplication was happening in the module loading system between:
1. The enhanced-client.js module
2. The enhanced-client-wrapper.js module 

Both were attempting to declare and export an `authServiceClient` object, causing a naming conflict when the modules were imported.

## Solution
We implemented the following changes:

### 1. Fixed the module structure in enhanced-client-wrapper.js
Rewrote the enhanced-client-wrapper.js module to use a more resilient approach:
- Replaced direct inheritance of the EnhancedClient class with composition
- Created a new EventAwareClient class that safely wraps the enhanced client functionality
- Added proper fallback mechanisms to handle potential import failures
- Implemented better error handling throughout the module

### 2. Updated the submission controller
Modified the submission.controller.js to correctly use the modular import approach:
- Changed the import to use the consistent module pattern
- Added fallback URL for the analysis service to improve resilience
- Ensured the module properly uses the exported objects

## Results
- The questionnaire service now successfully starts without any duplicate declaration errors
- The auth circuit breaker functionality works correctly
- The health endpoint confirms the service is operational with proper circuit breaker status

## Lessons Learned
- Class inheritance across dynamically loaded modules can cause issues in Node.js
- Composition provides a more resilient alternative to inheritance for dynamically loaded modules
- Adding proper fallbacks and error handling significantly improves service resilience
- Consistent module patterns help prevent naming conflicts
