# Questionnaire Service UUID User ID Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
The questionnaire service was experiencing Prisma validation errors when trying to query submissions with UUID-based user IDs. The error occurred because the code was attempting to convert UUID strings to numbers, resulting in `NaN` values that Prisma rejected.

## Root Cause
The submission controller contained complex OR queries that tried to handle user IDs as both strings and numbers:

```javascript
OR: [
  { userId: String(userId) },
  { userId: Number(userId) },  // This created NaN for UUIDs
  ...(isNaN(Number(userId)) ? [] : [{ userId: parseInt(userId) }])
]
```

When dealing with UUID strings like "ae721c92-5784-4996-812e-d54a2da93a22", `Number(userId)` would return `NaN`, causing Prisma validation errors.

## Error Details
```
PrismaClientValidationError: 
Invalid `prisma.submission.findMany()` invocation
Argument userId: Got invalid value NaN on prisma.findManySubmission. 
Provided Float, expected StringFilter or String
```

## Solution Applied
Simplified all Prisma queries in the submission controller to handle user IDs consistently as strings:

### Before:
```javascript
where: {
  OR: [
    { userId: String(userId) },
    { userId: Number(userId) },
    ...(isNaN(Number(userId)) ? [] : [{ userId: parseInt(userId) }])
  ]
}
```

### After:
```javascript
where: {
  userId: String(userId)
}
```

## Changes Made
Updated the following functions in `submission.controller.js`:
1. `getInProgressSubmissions()` - Fixed user ID matching for draft submissions
2. `getCompletedSubmissions()` - Fixed user ID matching for completed submissions  
3. `startSubmission()` - Fixed existing submission checks
4. User ownership validation throughout the controller

## Files Modified
- `risk-assessment-app/backend/questionnaire-service/src/controllers/submission.controller.js`

## Testing
- Service restart completed successfully
- Health checks are responding properly
- Ready to handle UUID-based user authentication without Prisma validation errors

## Impact
- ✅ Eliminates NaN validation errors in Prisma queries
- ✅ Properly supports UUID-based user identification
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with string user IDs
- ✅ Simplifies query logic and reduces complexity

The questionnaire service can now properly handle authenticated users with UUID-based user IDs without encountering Prisma validation errors.
