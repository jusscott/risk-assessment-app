# Rate Limiter Fix Summary

**Issue**: Users were getting "Too many authentication attempts, please try again later" error on the login page, preventing access to the application.

## Root Cause
The authentication rate limiter was configured too restrictively:
- **Previous**: 10 attempts per 5 minutes
- **Problem**: This limit was easily exceeded during normal usage, especially during development or when users had session timeouts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Immediate Fix - Cache Clearing
- **Created**: `clear-rate-limiter.js` script
- **Purpose**: Immediately clears rate limiter cache from Redis to restore access
- **Usage**: `node clear-rate-limiter.js`
- **Features**:
  - Automatically connects to Redis and clears rate limiting keys
  - Falls back to restarting API Gateway if Redis is unavailable
  - Provides detailed status updates during execution

### 2. Permanent Fix - Configuration Update
Updated `backend/api-gateway/src/middlewares/rate-limit.middleware.js`:

**Previous Configuration:**
```javascript
const authLimiter = createRateLimiter({
  windowMs: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  max: 10, // 10 attempts
  // ...
});
```

**New Configuration:**
```javascript
const authLimiter = createRateLimiter({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes  
  max: 25, // 25 attempts (more reasonable)
  // ...
});
```

### 3. Service Restart
- Restarted API Gateway container to apply new configuration
- All rate limiter caches reset with new limits

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Usability**: Users can now make 25 authentication attempts per 15-minute window instead of just 10 per 5 minutes
2. **Maintained Security**: Still prevents brute force attacks while allowing normal usage patterns
3. **Smart Key Generation**: Uses IP + User-Agent + email hash to distinguish between legitimate users from the same network
4. **Successful Request Exclusion**: Successful logins don't count against the rate limit

## Configuration Details

The rate limiter now allows:
- **25 authentication attempts per 15 minutes** (reasonable for normal usage)
- **Longer time window** (15 minutes vs 5 minutes) reduces the likelihood of hitting limits
- **Email-based differentiation** prevents legitimate users from being blocked by others' failed attempts
- **Test environment bypass** (1000 attempts in test mode)

## Prevention Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Monitor rate limiting metrics in production
2. Consider implementing graduated rate limiting based on user behavior
3. Add rate limit monitoring alerts
4. Document rate limiting policies for the development team

## Files Modified
- `backend/api-gateway/src/middlewares/rate-limit.middleware.js` - Updated auth rate limiter configuration
- `clear-rate-limiter.js` - Created emergency cache clearing script

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Rate limiter now allows reasonable authentication attempts while maintaining security

The login page should now be accessible for normal usage. The new configuration balances security with usability effectively.
