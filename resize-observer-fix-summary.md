# ResizeObserver Loop Error Fix

## Issue

After logging out of the development environment site and then trying to log back in, users experienced the following error:

```
Uncaught runtime errors:
Ã—
ERROR
ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications.
    at handleError (http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:156043:58)
    at http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:156062:7
```

## Root Cause

This error is a common issue with Material-UI components that use ResizeObserver internally. The error occurs when:

1. Components are rapidly unmounted and remounted during auth flow transitions
2. ResizeObserver notifications are still in the queue when components are unmounted
3. The browser tries to deliver notifications to components that no longer exist

This error specifically happens during the logout/login sequence because:
- During logout, components are unmounted
- During login attempt, new components are mounted
- The rapid transition doesn't give browser time to properly clean up ResizeObserver notifications

## Solution

The solution implemented has two parts:

1. Created a utility file `resize-observer-fix.ts` that:
   - Intercepts and filters ResizeObserver-related error messages
   - Prevents them from being logged to the console
   - Adds a global error handler to prevent errors from bubbling up

2. Modified `App.tsx` to:
   - Import the ResizeObserver fix utility
   - Initialize the fix during app startup via a useEffect hook
   - Ensure the fix is applied before any components render

The approach is non-invasive and doesn't modify Material-UI's core functionality. Instead, it works by suppressing the error notifications that are harmless but confusing to users.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created `frontend/src/utils/resize-observer-fix.ts`

This utility file provides two key functions:
- `fixResizeObserverErrors()`: Overrides console.error to filter out ResizeObserver-related messages
- `initResizeObserverFix()`: Sets up event listeners to capture and prevent error propagation

### 2. Updated `App.tsx`

Added the following code to initialize the fix:

```tsx
// Import the utility
import initResizeObserverFix from './utils/resize-observer-fix';

// Initialize during component mount
useEffect(() => {
  initResizeObserverFix();
  console.log('ResizeObserver fix initialized');
}, []);
```

## Benefits

- Eliminates confusing error messages during authentication flows
- Improves user experience during login/logout cycles
- Non-intrusive solution that doesn't require changes to Material-UI components
- Simple implementation that's easy to maintain

## Testing

To verify the fix, perform the following test:
1. Log out of the application
2. Immediately try to log back in
3. Confirm no ResizeObserver errors appear in the console
