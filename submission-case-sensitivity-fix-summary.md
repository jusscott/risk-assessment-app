# Submission Case Sensitivity Fix Summary

## Issue
The questionnaire submission system was encountering errors with the error message:
```
Unknown field `template` for include statement on model Submission. Available options are listed in green. Did you mean `Template`?
Unknown field `answers` for include statement on model Submission. Available options are listed in green. Did you mean `Answer`?
```

## Root Cause Analysis
This was a case sensitivity issue with the Prisma relation field names. In the Prisma schema, the relation fields in the Submission model are defined with capitalized names:

```prisma
model Submission {
  // other fields...
  Answer     Answer[]  // Capitalized
  Template   Template @relation(fields: [templateId], references: [id])  // Capitalized
}
```

However, in the submission.controller.js file, these fields were being referenced with lowercase names:

```javascript
include: {
  template: { // Should be "Template"
    // ...
  },
  answers: true // Should be "Answer"
}
```

## Fix Implemented
A script was created to automatically correct all instances of these field names in the controller:

1. Created a fix script (`fix-submission-case-sensitivity.js`) that:
   - Replaced lowercase field references (`template`, `answers`) with proper capitalized versions (`Template`, `Answer`)
   - Fixed all related code that referenced these fields through dot notation (`submission.template` â†’ `submission.Template`)
   - Preserved the functionality while ensuring field names match Prisma's schema definition

2. Restarted the questionnaire service to apply the changes

## Technical Details
- Prisma is case-sensitive with relation field names and they must match exactly as defined in the schema
- The fix ensures proper capitalization in all include statements and field references
- The issue affected multiple functions in the submission controller, including:
  - getInProgressSubmissions
  - getCompletedSubmissions
  - getSubmissionById
  - Various other submission processing functions

## Verification
The service has been restarted with the fix applied. The questionnaire submission system should now function correctly without the case sensitivity errors.

## Lessons Learned
- When working with Prisma relations, maintain consistent casing between schema definitions and controller code
- Field names in Prisma schema should be treated as exact identifiers, not just semantically equivalent names
- Consider implementing additional validation or linting to catch these issues early in the development process
