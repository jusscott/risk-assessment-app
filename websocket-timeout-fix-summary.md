# WebSocket Timeout Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved

Fixed WebSocket timeout issues in the Analysis Service during heavy processing tasks. Previously, when the Analysis Service performed CPU-intensive analysis operations, the main JavaScript event loop would be blocked, causing WebSocket connections to the Report Service to time out. This resulted in report generation failures as the Report Service wasn't notified of completed analyses.

## Solution Components

1. **Core Socket Management Utility** (`socket-timeout-fix.js`)
   - Provides robust WebSocket connection management
   - Implements automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Includes buffering and message prioritization
   - Maintains active connection monitoring and heartbeats

2. **Service Integration Layer** (`webhook-socket-integration.js`)
   - Provides task queuing for sequential processing of analysis jobs
   - Implements retry logic with backoff for failed tasks
   - Ensures reliable WebSocket message delivery
   - Manages report service connections

3. **Webhook Controller Updates**
   - Now uses queuing system to prevent parallel heavy processing
   - Leverages timeout-protected WebSocket communication
   - Improved error handling and recovery logic

4. **Configuration**
   - Added socket-specific configuration in `config.js`
   - Parameterized all timeout and connection settings
   - Environment variable support for all connection parameters

## Technical Implementation

### Task Queuing Approach

The solution queues analysis tasks instead of processing them in parallel:

```javascript
async function queueAnalysisTask(submissionId, userId) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Add task to queue with callback for completion
    analysisQueue.push({
      submissionId,
      userId,
      resolve,
      reject,
      attempts: 0,
      maxAttempts: 3,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
    
    // Start processing the queue if not already running
    if (!isProcessingQueue) {
      processAnalysisQueue();
    }
  });
}
```

### Message Delivery With Timeout Protection

Messages are now sent with priority settings and timeout protection:

```javascript
async function notifyReportServiceWithTimeout(analysisId, userId) {
  // Ensure connection is established
  if (!reportServiceConnected) {
    initReportServiceConnection();
    // Wait for connection with timeout
    // ...
  }
  
  // Send the notification with high priority
  const message = {
    type: 'analysis_complete',
    analysisId,
    userId,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  };
  
  // Use the WebSocket timeout fix
  sendMessage(REPORT_SERVICE_CONN_ID, message, { priority: 'high' });
  
  return { success: true };
}
```

## Testing

A dedicated test suite verifies the fix:
- Integration tests simulating heavy processing scenarios
- Concurrent operation testing
- Connection reliability verification

The tests can be run using:
```bash
cd backend/analysis-service
./scripts/run-websocket-test.sh
```

## Performance Considerations

This implementation prioritizes reliability over raw performance:
- Tasks are processed sequentially rather than in parallel
- Overall throughput may be slightly reduced for multiple concurrent submissions
- System stability and reliability are significantly improved

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available at:
- `backend/analysis-service/docs/WEBSOCKET-TIMEOUT-FIX.md`

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the solution in production to ensure it fully resolves the timeout issues
2. Consider implementing dynamic concurrency if the sequential processing becomes a bottleneck
3. Explore options for more advanced task prioritization in the future
